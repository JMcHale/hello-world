# hello-world
The first of many Gits. MANY. Hopefully.

I am currently in production and projects in the manufacturing sector, and am looking to learn more about the wonderful world of coding. Because it's hella interesting. Wonderful.

This is a change that's been made using the Git CLI commands. It's a test. How do we get this back to github??? Who KNOWS?!
