# hello-world
The first of many Gits. MANY. Hopefully.

Instead of a mess of words how about a recipe for cheese.

Leave milk in a pan. Heat it.

This is a change that's been made using the Git CLI commands. It's a test. How do we get this back to github??? Who KNOWS?!

Then eat the cheese when done with work. Delicous!

Maybe I'll add my secret recipe here??? ;)
